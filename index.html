    <hr class="content__hr">
    <p class="content__p">Hello! My name is Myumi and I like to write code. Descended from Japanese royalty and a childhood addiction to <em>Neopets</em>, I started the basics programming at an early age. An in-game CSS guide gave me my first dip into code, however, it wasn't until high school that I realized HTML/CSS/JS wasn't just for <em>Neopets</em>.
    </p>
        <p class="content__p">
          Since then, I have travelled across the country to work as a video game developer, and flown back home to New Jersey pursue software development. Now, I am looking to root myself into what made me the happiest when I was programming: web design and development.
          </p>
    <p class="content__p">
      I can most frequently be found sewing new toys for my eccentric and elderly furrball, cooking up something vegan and delicious, or playing nostalgic video game melodies on bass.
    </p>
    <p class="content__p">
      Whether you're interested in collborating on something fun or inquiring about an interview, I can best be reached via email.
